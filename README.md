# [Next 13 starters with authentication and database set up](https://saasyland.com)

Starter templates for [Next.js 13](https://nextjs.org/) full-stack projects. Built with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [ShadCn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/), authentication, and database. Several branches contain several different configurations, including serverless databases like PostgreSQL with [Neon](https://neon.tech), or MySQL with [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com), [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team/), [Prisma ORM v.5](https://www.prisma.io/) (serverless-compatible), but also [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database), [Supabase](https://supabase.com/), and even [Nest.js](https://nestjs.com/), [Express (MERN stack)](https://expressjs.com/), or [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/). All users are stored in a database, regardless of whether they signed up with email and password, magic link, or via an OAuth provider.

**The project is currently under active development. Please check back soon.**

## Available configurations:

- ### [next-auth-drizzle-neon-postgres](https://github.com/pjborowiecki/SAASY-LAND-Next-13-Starters-With-Authentication-And-Database-Implemented/tree/next-auth-drizzle-planetscale-mysql)

This branch contains a Next.js 13 starter with Next-Auth authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), and a PostgreSQL database set up at [Neon](https://neon.tech). The database is connected with [Drizzle ORM](https://orm.drizzle.team), which is serverless-compatible. OAuth authentication is also set up for GitHub and Google providers. The set up contains email verification and password reset functionality, both set up with [Resend](https://resend.com) and [React Email](https://react).
